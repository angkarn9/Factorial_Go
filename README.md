# Factorial_Go
Practice Golang With Factorial

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. 

### For example,
```
5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 
```

### 1. cd to path Factorial_Go
```
Command : cd path/Factorial_Go
```

### 2. run file setenv for set environment golang
```
Command : . ./setenv
```

### 3. Check Go environments are correct
```
Command : go env
```

### 4. run go
```
Command : go run main.go
```
> Result : 120

### 5. run test go functions
```
Command : cd factorial
Command : go test -v (For run all testcases)
Command : go test -run #NameTestCase (For run specific TestCase)
```
